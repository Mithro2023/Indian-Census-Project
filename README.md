This project showcases my SQL skills in analyzing data from Indian government datasets (indian.gov), focusing on demographic and economic statistics for Indian states. I performed tasks such as calculating totals and averages for key indicators, including population, growth, and literacy rates, and identified trends such as the top and bottom-performing states in growth and literacy. I employed advanced SQL techniques, such as UNION, temporary tables, and pattern matching, to uncover valuable insights, including states with high literacy rates and specific naming patterns. Additionally, I used SQL functions and conditional filtering to prepare the data for visualization, ultimately creating reports that highlight demographic trends and performance metrics. These insights were pivotal in supporting data-driven decisions and strategic planning. The project exemplifies my ability to work with complex datasets and extract actionable insights using SQL.
